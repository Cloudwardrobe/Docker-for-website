We have used a online purchase site prototype and tried to deploy it using Docker container and manage it using Kubernetes.

ns.yaml - namespace file
deployment.yaml - Deployment file
service.yaml - service file

We dockerised the html by 
	using nginx:alphine proxy serve and building image and containerizing it

we used minikube to create a single cluster

we deployed the pod 

set replicas and resource limits
